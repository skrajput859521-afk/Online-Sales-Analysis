## 🔑 Key Steps in Analysis

1. **Data Cleaning**

   * Converted `Order Date` column to datetime format
   * Extracted `Order Month` for time-based grouping

2. **Sales Analysis**

   * Sales by **Month** (trend analysis)
   * Sales by **Category** (bar chart)
   * Sales by **Sub-Category** (bar chart, sorted)

3. **Profit Analysis**

   * Profit by **Month** (bar chart trend)

4. **Visualization**

   * Line graph for monthly sales trend
   * Bar graphs for sales by category, sub-category, and profit by month

## 📊 Example Visualizations

* **Sales Trend (Line Graph)**
* **Sales by Category (Bar Chart)**
* **Sales by Sub-Category (Bar Chart)**
* **Profit by Month (Bar Chart)**
